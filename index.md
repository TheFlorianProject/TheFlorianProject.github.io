# The Project
To create a tracking system for Firefighters for when they are in a fire.


# The Problem

There is currently no way to track the position of a firefighter when in a large building fire. If a firefighter needs assistance at anytime, it can be hard to know their location to be able to give them the assistance that they need. We seek to create a rapidly deployable tracking system for firefighters to be able to use, so there is no question as to where the firefighters are.
