# The Problem

There is currently no way to track the position of a firefighter when in a large building fire. If a firefighter needs assistance at anytime, it can be hard to know their location to be able to give them the assistance that they need.

# Our Solution

We seek to create a rapidly deployable tracking system for firefighters to be able to use, so there is no question as to where the firefighters are. Our system uses DWM1001C UWB Tracking Modules to trilateral the position of individual firefighters within a geofenced area.
